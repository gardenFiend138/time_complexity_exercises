# Time Complexity Practice

1. Specify which aspect (or aspects) of the input the time complexity depends on. E.g., if a function is O(n), what is n?
2. Explain thoroughly and clearly why the time complexity is what it is.
3. Find the worst cases.
4. Discuss space complexity too: this is usually deemphasized over time complexity, but some interviewers will ask about it.

1. ```ruby 
def add(a, b)
  if a > b
    return a + b
  end

  a - b
end
```
